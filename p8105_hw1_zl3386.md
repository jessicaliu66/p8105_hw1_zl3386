# Problem 1

## The `early_january_weather` dataset

The `early_january_weather` dataset contains hourly meterological data
for LGA, JFK and EWR for the month of January 2013. It is a subset of
the `weather` data frame from `nycflights13`.

- It has 15 variables, including `origin`(weather station), `year`,
  `month`, `day`, `hour`, `time_hour`(date and hour of the recording as
  a *POSIXct* date) and indicators of weather.
- It has 358 rows and 15 columns.
- The mean temperature is 39.5821229 °F.

## Scatterplot

Using the data from`early_january_weather`, we can make a scatterplot of
`temp` vs `time_hour`, using `humid` to determine the color of each
point.

From the scatterplot, we can see that the temperature in the month of
January 2013 has fluctuations but goes up in general over time, and the
relative humidity is higher in late January.

We will save this scatterplot as a png file (`scatterplot.png`) in the
project directory.

# Problem 2

## Create a dataframe

For Problem 2, we will create a data frame `example_df` comprised of:

- `num_samp`: a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal
  distribution.
- `log_vec`: a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample
  are greater than 0.
- `char_vec`: a character vector of length 10.
- `fac_vec`: a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor
  “levels”.

``` r
example_df =
  tibble(
    num_samp = rnorm(10),
    log_vec = num_samp >=0,
    char_vec = c("M", "S", "S", "M", "L", "M", "M", "M", "S", "M"),
    fac_vec = factor(char_vec, levels= c("s", "M", "L"))
  )
```

## Take the mean

We can then try to take the mean of each variable in `example_df`.

``` r
x1 = mean(pull(example_df, var = num_samp))
x2 = mean(pull(example_df, var = log_vec))
x3 = mean(pull(example_df, var = char_vec))
x4 = mean(pull(example_df, var = fac_vec))
```

- For `num_samp`, the mean is -0.3354384.
- For `log_vec`, the mean is 0.3.
- For `char_vec` and `fac_vec`, their mean cannot be taken and the
  return value is NA.

## Explicitly convert variable types

Finally, we will try to convert variables from other types (logical,
character and factor) to numeric.

``` r
y1 = as.numeric(pull(example_df, var = log_vec))
y2 = as.numeric(pull(example_df, var = char_vec))
y3 = as.numeric(pull(example_df, var = fac_vec))
```

- For `log_vec`, the logical value TRUE is converted to 1, and FALSE is
  converted to 0.
- For `char_vec`, all values are converted to NA.
- For `fac_vec`, the value of the first level is converted to NA, while
  the values of the other levels are converted according to their order.

This helps explain what happens when we try to take the mean – when
asked to calculate the mean of a non-numeric variable, R will first try
to convert it to a numeric variable. But because of the NA that exists
after the conversion, R cannot take the mean of character or factor
variables, and can only return NA as a result.
